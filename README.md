# Mahlet — Personal Website

This is a small starter website for the assignment. It contains the six required pages:

- `index.html` — Home page with name and short intro
- `about.html` — About page with background and interests
- `education.html` — Education history
- `skills.html` — Technical and soft skills
- `projects.html` — Two sample projects with file downloader 
- `contact.html` — Contact info and a demo contact form

Folders:
- `css/` — Styles (responsive)
- `js/` — JavaScript for form validation and mobile nav
- `images/` — photo placeholders

How to use
1. Open `index.html` in your browser to preview locally.
2. Edit the pages and replace placeholder content (email address, education details, photo) with your own.

Submission checklist (what to upload):
- ZIP file of the source code (your repository root). On Windows PowerShell you can run:

  ```powershell
  Compress-Archive -Path .\* -DestinationPath ..\mahlet-personal wbesite 
  ```

- GitHub repository link with your source code.
- Hosted website URL via GitHub Pages.

How to host on GitHub Pages (quick steps):
1. Create a new repository on GitHub and push your project there (make sure `index.html` is at the repo root).
2. In the repository Settings → Pages, choose the branch (e.g., `main`) and root as the folder and save.
3. GitHub will provide a URL like `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/` once published.

Notes & encouraged practices
- Keep the `css/`, `js/`, and `images/` folders.
- Use meaningful file and class names (already applied in starter files).
- Test responsiveness by resizing your browser or using device emulation tools.
